M3 Data Centre Move Outage
**************************

.. important::
    As per the `Data Centre Move <http://www.monash.edu/esolutions/announcements/data-centre-move>`_ annoucement, 
    Monash University is establishing a modern environment for future research 
    computing needs. To do this, eSolutions are moving all eResearch 
    infrastructure to a new data centre. This move will happen during January 
    and February 2017.
    
MASSIVE will be impacted in the following way:

Phase 1
-------
14 - 22 January 2017

Our high performance computing and research data systems will be completely 
offline. Users of M3 (Monash) will not be able to login or run desktop 
sessions during this week.

A reservation will be put in place to allow jobs to run up until but not 
into the outage window. Long running jobs will therefore not run prior to 
the outage. All pending jobs will be cancelled as part of the shutdown.

All system backups will be run prior to the move as per the automated schedule. 
There is a small risk that M3 temporary scratch data may be lost during the 
move as this is not backed up. 

As the MASSIVE hardware is being completely dismantled and rebuilt, there is 
likely to be some hardware failure. We expect this to be minimal and are 
focusing on core services so the majority of the cluster will be operational
on the 22nd of Jan. We will notify you of the system status on the 22nd of Jan.

Phase 2
-------
Early February to early March 2017

Our Research Cloud will be moved gradually, while keeping the overall service
online. This may impact some services for a short amount of time 
(e.g. Strudel Web) and only be for a few mintues. Only users that may be 
impacted will be notified in advance.

If you have any issues please do not hesitate to email help@massive.org.au
