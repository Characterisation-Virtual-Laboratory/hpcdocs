********************
MASSIVE Terms of Use
********************

Use of the MASSIVE facility is subject to Monash University's
`Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy [PDF] <https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1092699/Information-Technology-Acceptable-Use-Policy.pdf>`_ and
`Information Technology Acceptable Use Procedure [PDF] <https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1092779/Information-Technology-acceptable-Use-Procedure.pdf>`_.

When reading the `Information Technology Acceptable Use Procedure [PDF] <https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1092779/Information-Technology-acceptable-Use-Procedure.pdf>`_, note in particular section 2 *Responsibilities of users*:

Regarding Use of Monash University Computer Accounts each authorised user is responsible for:

- The security of personally owned computers and equipment used in conjunction
  with the University's IT Services
- Usage of the unique computer accounts which the University has authorised for
  the user's benefit, these accounts are not transferable
- Selecting and keeping a secure password for each of these accounts, including
  not sharing passwords and logging off after using a computer
- Familiarising themselves with legislative requirements which impact on the use
  of IT Resources and acting accordingly, using the University IT Resources in
  an ethical and lawful way, in accordance with Australian laws/relevant local
  laws where a student is based in another country
- Cooperating with other users of the ICT facilities to ensure fair and
  equitable access to the facilities
- Observing the obligations under these Procedures
- Observing the Terms of Service or Acceptable Use policies of third party
  products or services that have been engaged by the University
- IT Resources must not be used for private commercial purposes except where the
  paid work is conducted in accordance with the University Practice and Paid
  Outside Work Policy, or the work is for the purposes of a corporate entity in
  which Monash University holds an interest

The University accepts no responsibility for:

- Loss or damage or consequential loss or damage, arising from the use of its
  IT Services for academic or personal purposes
- Loss of data or interference with files arising from its efforts to maintain
  the IT Services
- Users whose actions breach legislation â€“ for further information refer to
  the section of this policy titled Relevant Australian Legislation, Policies
  and Associated Documentation

The above translates to not sharing accounts or account details. For MASSIVE
this is particularly important as it is a system linked to many other systems.
It is vital to restrict access to the individual that has accepted these terms
and conditions, so that the system is used fairly and securely for all other
users. Users are limited to one account each. If you need an additional account
(e.g. for a particular instrument) contact the `MASSIVE helpdesk <mailto:help@massive.org.au>`_.

In addition to the University Terms and Conditions we also ask users to follow
the HPC etiquette:

#. Login nodes are used only for light single core processing tasks e.g.
    #. Submitting jobs
    #. Compiling code
    #. Light pre/post processing of jobs
#. Moving data to and from MASSIVE should be done using the data transfer node (dtn)
#. Do not run jobs on the login nodes
#. Do not write scripts that poll the queuing system continuously (i.e. loops
   of less than 1 minute)

The above is important as the login nodes are a shared resource and the only
entry point to MASSIVE. If all the resources or services are consumed by one
user, all other users are denied access to MASSIVE.
