About Field of Research (FOR) and Socio-Economic Objective (SEO) codes
**********************************************************************

MASSIVE collects `Field of Research (FOR) and Socio-Economic Objective (SEO) codes <https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/grant-application/classification-codes-rfcd-seo-and-anzsic-codes>`_ as part of the project application process; these codes form part of the project data. Collecting FOR and SEO codes, as well as other metadata, allows MASSIVE to accurately report on our user base, apply for funding, and demonstrate our continuing contribution to the research community.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes `a list of FOR codes <http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6BB427AB9696C225CA2574180004463E?opendocument>`_ and `a list of SEO codes <http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/CF7ADB06FA2DFD69CA2574180004CB82>`_; we recommend consulting these documents when completing your project application. 

We request FOR codes in the format ``1234 @ 56.78%``, with a minimum of 4 digits for each FOR code. 

If a *single* FOR code applies to your work, supply 100%. If *multiple* FOR codes apply to your work, supply multiple percentages that sum to 100%. 

.. important:: 
    For example: A project has two applicable FOR codes: 080302 Computer System Architecture, and 080501 Distributed and Grid Systems. If these codes are evenly weighted, supply ``FOR=080302 @ 50%, 080501 @ 50%``. If one code is weighted more heavily than the other, supply ``FOR=080302 @ 75%, 080501 @ 25%`` or ``FOR=080302 @ 55%, 080501 @ 45%``

We request a single SEO code in the format ``123456``, with a minimum of 2 digits for the SEO code.
